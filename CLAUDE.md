# Dusklight VR mod — working notes

Twilight Princess PC port ("dusklight") with an in-progress VR mod. This file
tracks the state of active VR debugging so a session can be resumed cleanly
after a break. It reflects the working tree as of 2026-07-29; check `git
status`/`git diff` against this list before trusting anything below, since
these are hand-maintained notes, not generated from the diff.

## Build workflow

- `cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-relwithdebinfo` needs the MSVC dev
  environment loaded first (plain shells fail with missing standard headers).
  Use a batch file: `call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"`
  then `cd /d C:\Users\joeyw\dusklight && cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-relwithdebinfo`,
  invoked via `cmd //c path\to\build.bat`. Don't pass a `cmd //c "... && ..."`
  string directly through git-bash — write it to a `.bat` file and invoke that.
- **Always check `tasklist //FI "IMAGENAME eq dusklight.exe"` before building**
  — if the game is running it locks the exe and the link step fails with
  `LNK1104`. Ask the user to close it first.
- Debugging loop that works well for VR rendering bugs: add targeted
  `OutputDebugStringA` logging (fire once or a capped handful of times, never
  every frame), rebuild, ask the user to test in the headset and paste back
  the Output-window lines (they run the game under Visual Studio's debugger
  — Debug → Attach to Process if launched via something else like
  RenderDoc — and read them from VS's Output pane). For visual symptoms hard
  to describe in words, dumping raw pixel buffers to disk (BMP → PNG) for
  direct inspection has worked well in the past (see the eye-buffer BMP
  dump tooling in `vr_xr_submit.hpp`, built 2026-07-29, generically
  reusable). Remove all diagnostic scaffolding once a bug is confirmed
  fixed.
- **When the `OutputDebugStringA`-log-and-guess loop stalls, reach for a
  RenderDoc GPU capture sooner rather than later** — it's what actually
  found the water-black root cause 2026-07-29 after many rounds of guessing.
  Gotchas specific to this project: (1) RenderDoc's own hotkey capture
  (F12) only sees the DESKTOP window's `Present()` calls, which are
  essentially empty while VR is active (the game skips its own desktop
  redraw then) — confirmed via two real captures containing nothing but a
  fence signal and a `Present`. (2) Instead, launch via RenderDoc's "Launch
  Application", then trigger a capture from in-game code: `m_Do_main.cpp`
  has an **F9 hotkey** (`getRenderDocApi()`/the `rdocCapturing` block in
  `main01()`) that brackets `StartFrameCapture`/`EndFrameCapture` around the
  actual `aurora_begin_frame()`/`aurora_end_frame()` pair, which is where
  VR's real GPU submission happens — this produced a real, useful ~634MB
  capture on the first try. `src/dusk/vr/renderdoc_app.h` (copied from the
  installed RenderDoc's own SDK header) is required for this to compile;
  it's a vendored, unmodified official header, safe to keep. (3) Debug-group
  markers (`GX_DEBUG_GROUP`, named like `dComIfGd_drawXluListInvisible` —
  handy for finding specific draw calls in the Event Browser) are OFF by
  default outside `Debug` builds — the build cache currently has
  `DUSK_GFX_DEBUG_GROUPS=ON` forced via `cmake --preset
  windows-msvc-relwithdebinfo -DDUSK_GFX_DEBUG_GROUPS=ON` (persists across
  incremental rebuilds; only needs re-passing after a fresh/deleted build
  dir). Even with that on, the markers won't show up in RenderDoc without
  `WinPixEventRuntime.dll` present (not currently in the build output) — Dawn
  silently no-ops debug markers on D3D12 without it. Without markers,
  searching the Resource Inspector by a resource's known
  width/height/format (sort or filter the Texture List) and checking its
  "Used in Frame" events is a reliable fallback for finding the right draw
  calls.

## Overall VR status

Renders correctly end-to-end as of the 2026-07-27 session: no crash, fills
the frame, correct stereo (not crossed/stretched). Water no longer renders
solid black as of 2026-07-29 (see section 3) — that specific blocking bug
is fixed and stable. Reflection *quality* is a separate, still-unresolved
follow-up: many rounds were tried 2026-07-29 (real capture with
ordering/size fixes → ghosting; solid color → stable but opaque/flat;
gradient/stripes → no visible improvement) without fully converging, and
the session was deliberately stopped there per explicit user agreement
rather than continuing to iterate blindly — see section 3's "Options for a
future session" for where to pick this up. Not a blocker, just imperfect.
Other known issues below.

## Currently uncommitted working-tree changes

`extern/aurora` (submodule, dirty working tree — NOT yet committed even
inside the submodule):
- `include/aurora/gfx.hpp` / `lib/gfx/common.cpp`: `begin_offscreen()`/
  `end_offscreen()` now suspend-and-resume correctly when a NEW offscreen
  pass (`GXCreateFrameBuffer`) opens while a *protected* offscreen pass (a VR
  eye) is already active, instead of silently losing track of it. This was
  written to fix "water/heat-wave indirect-distortion effects rendering
  solid black in VR" but **turned out not to be the actual cause of the
  black-water bug** (see below) — it's still a real, correct fix for genuine
  `GXCreateFrameBuffer`-nesting-under-VR cases (e.g. if the bloom/DOF guards
  below are ever removed), just not sufficient by itself for water.

Main repo, by topic:

### 1. Shadows — intentionally DISABLED in VR, do not re-enable without new evidence
- `src/m_Do/m_Do_graphic.cpp`: `GX_DEBUG_GROUP(dComIfGd_drawShadow, ...)` call
  guarded by `!dusk::vr::isRenderingToHeadset()`.
- `src/d/d_drawlist.cpp`: `dDlst_shadowSimple_c::draw()` early-returns when
  `g_duskVRRenderingToHeadset`.
- Also in `d_drawlist.cpp`: double-precision fixes for
  `dDlst_shadowReal_c::setShadowRealMtx()`'s view*proj concat, and in
  `vr_stereo_render.hpp`'s `eyePoseToViewMtx()` (translation math), targeting
  float32 precision loss at this game's huge (~30,000–100,000+ unit) world
  coordinates. **These were tried and confirmed (by testing) to NOT fix the
  visible stretching.** A past session mistakenly re-enabled shadows
  reasoning "the fix landed, the disable must be stale" — it hadn't, and
  re-enabling just reproduced the same stretching. **Lesson: do not infer
  that a nearby fix supersedes a disable guard without checking — ask, or
  look for an explicit "confirmed still broken" comment first.**
- Status: shadows stay off in VR until someone picks this up with fresh
  diagnostics. The precision fixes are harmless and can stay.

### 2. Actor-culling — fixed
- `vr_stereo_render.hpp`'s `beginEye()`: `mDoLib_clipper` (actor visibility
  frustum) is rebuilt every eye from the real asymmetric VR FOV (smallest
  symmetric frustum that fully contains it), instead of the stale flatscreen
  camera's ~60°/1.357 values. Fixed the "objects fade in/out near the edge of
  the visor" issue.
- Deliberately does **not** touch `view->fovy`/`view->aspect` themselves,
  since those also drive particle billboarding, rain shadow-projection,
  audio spatialization, and the modding API — scoped to just the clipper via
  a parallel computation, to avoid side effects on those other systems.

### 3. Water rendering solid black in VR — ROOT-CAUSED AND FIXED 2026-07-29
**Original symptom** (user-confirmed): ALL water in the game — lakes,
rivers, waterfalls, still or flowing — rendered as pitch black, fully
opaque, no visible texture, only in VR (fine on flatscreen). **Now fixed**:
water shows real (if visually imperfect — see "Remaining issue" below)
content in VR instead of solid black, confirmed by the user in-headset
after the fix below, at the exact camera angle from the original bug
report. No regressions found in the "black screen after loading a save"
fix this touches (user explicitly re-tested loading a save after this fix
— still works).

**Actual root cause** (found via RenderDoc GPU capture, see the long
investigation trail below for everything that was ruled out first): this
game's water does NOT have a real per-surface reflection asset or a real
planar reflection render — it uses the cheap, old-game trick of sampling a
recent **screen capture** (the scene as it looked a moment ago), distorted
through the UV-generation matrix already fixed in Round 1, to fake a
shimmering reflection. That screen capture is `mDoGph_gInf_c::
getFrameBufferTex()` (a shared, single 304×224 texture —
`FB_WIDTH_BASE/2 × FB_HEIGHT_BASE/2`, confirmed via RenderDoc's Resource
Inspector matching the exact dimensions found for water's bound texture in
Round 8's read-only introspection), populated by `retry_captue_frame()`
(`m_Do_graphic.cpp`) via a `GXCopyTex`.

`retry_captue_frame()` was unconditionally skipped in VR at every call site
(`if (!dusk::vr::isRenderingToHeadset()) { retry_captue_frame(...); }`) —
guards added in an earlier session to fix a *different* bug ("black screen
after loading a save"), because the underlying `GXCopyTex` → `resolve_pass_
into()` substitution used to unconditionally corrupt VR's protected eye
pass if it ran mid-eye-render. Skipping it fixed that bug but, as an
unintended side effect, meant this shared screen-capture texture never got
written to during VR at all — leaving it permanently at whatever it was
initialized to. This is exactly why the user recalled water used to show
"an attempt to display what my view was in the headset" (a stale/frozen
screen capture, from before these guards existed) and only went solid black
after that fix landed.

**The fix (two parts, both required — first alone was NOT sufficient,
confirmed by testing)**:
1. `extern/aurora/lib/gfx/common.cpp`, `resolve_pass_into()`: previously
   this dropped the entire substitution (returned early, doing nothing) if
   the current pass was VR's protected eye pass. Changed to let the
   substitution through. Verified safe because: the substitution always
   carries the same `colorView`/`depthStencilView` forward onto the new pass
   object it creates (only the pass *wrapper* gets a new id, not the actual
   render target) — and `resolve_pass_checked()` (used by `endEye()` to
   close out the eye pass afterward) already had a fallback for exactly this
   case (id mismatch alone isn't treated as failure if `colorView` still
   matches). After the split, `g_protectedOffscreenPassId` is updated to
   the new pass's id so other internal checks (e.g. `begin_offscreen()`'s
   own nesting detection) don't lose track of it either.
2. `m_Do_graphic.cpp`: re-enabled the
   `retry_captue_frame()` call site right before the Invisible-list draw
   (~line 2629 pre-this-session, the one that runs unconditionally every
   frame aside from the VR guard) by removing its `!dusk::vr::
   isRenderingToHeadset()` guard entirely. This is the ONE call site
   confirmed sufficient to fix water — the other 3 guarded call sites
   (`F_SP124`-stage-specific, bloom's, and the `#if DEBUG` darkworld one —
   see section 4) were deliberately left alone; not yet confirmed necessary
   or safe to also re-enable.

**Remaining issue (NOT the black bug — a visual quality/accuracy problem)
— STOPPED HERE 2026-07-29 after many rounds, per explicit user agreement
("one more focused attempt, but if it doesn't land, stop regardless") —
the focused attempt below did not resolve it. Picking this up fresh with a
different approach (see "options for a future session" at the end) is
probably more productive than continuing to iterate on the current one.**

Full history of what was tried, in order:

- **Ghosting round 1** (per-eye capture ordering): confirmed the reflection
  showed REAL content once the black bug was fixed, but with duplicated
  ghost copies of Link's own model and wrong crops (a band of sky where
  rock should be). Root cause found: `retry_captue_frame()`'s capture for a
  given eye was being read by that SAME eye's water draw only if it ran
  AFTER the capture in `mDoGph_Painter()`'s per-frame sequence — depending
  on `g_env_light.is_blure`, water's Invisible-list draw could happen
  BEFORE that frame's capture, reading the OTHER eye's (or previous
  frame's) capture instead — a view offset by the full stereo
  interpupillary distance. **Fixed**: added a VR-only early capture call
  right before the first Invisible-list draw check, so water always reads
  at-worst-one-eye-stale data instead of a different eye's view outright.
  Improved things ("a little better") but did not fully fix the ghosting.
- **Destination-size bug** (found alongside the above): `retry_captue_frame()`
  on the `TARGET_PC` path passed the FULL captured width/height to
  `GXSetTexCopyDst()`, while the real destination texture
  (`mDoGph_gInf_c::getFrameBufferTex()`) is allocated at HALF that size —
  the non-PC branch already used the half-size values
  (`var_r24`/`var_r23`) the PC branch computed but never used. **Fixed** by
  using the half-size values on the PC path too. Confirmed as a real bug
  (destination size now matches the real texture), but did not resolve the
  ghosting on its own either.
- **User's diagnosis** (correct, and the reason further real-capture fixes
  were abandoned): a VR headset moves in ways a flatscreen third-person
  camera never does (free rotation, no camera-position clamping, quick
  head turns) — this screen-capture-as-reflection technique fundamentally
  assumes smooth, bounded camera motion. Chasing every VR-specific
  mismatch this exposes has diminishing returns; a placeholder approach
  was tried instead of continuing to patch the real capture.
- **Solid-color-in-a-new-offscreen-pass (CRASHED, do not retry as
  written)**: tried opening a NEW nested offscreen pass (`GXCreateFrameBuffer`)
  to draw an exact solid color while already inside VR's protected eye
  pass. This is a genuine second-level-of-nesting case: the `GXCopyTex`
  inside that nested pass triggers `resolve_pass_into()`'s ordinary
  pass-substitution, which `begin_offscreen()`/`end_offscreen()`'s
  single-slot suspend/resume mechanism (`extern/aurora/lib/gfx/common.cpp`,
  comment: "Only one level of nesting is tracked") does not account for —
  corrupts which pass index gets resumed, crashes on the next
  `SetViewport` call with "Attempted to append command SetViewport to
  sealed render pass". **Do not retry this exact approach** without first
  extending that suspend/resume logic for arbitrary nesting depth (bigger,
  riskier change than this fallback is worth) — reverted immediately.
- **Tiny-real-scene-corner capture (reverted, didn't crash, didn't work)**:
  tried capturing a real but tiny (16×16 logical pixel) corner of the
  actual scene instead of the whole view, theorizing it'd look
  "blurred/uniform" once scaled up. In practice the corner still contains
  real (if blocky) scene content and visibly changed color with head
  movement — not an improvement.
- **Solid-color quad drawn directly into the current pass (no crash, but
  flat/lifeless)**: switched to drawing an actual solid-color quad directly
  into the ALREADY-OPEN eye pass (no new pass at all — avoids the crash
  above entirely), in a small corner, then capturing just that quad. This
  worked without crashing and gave a stable (non-flashing) color, but the
  user correctly identified two problems: (1) fully opaque, no
  see-through/transparency (confirmed later that flatscreen water genuinely
  IS see-through to the lakebed — this is a real regression, not a
  pre-existing design limit); (2) a perfectly uniform color gives the
  water's own wind-driven UV distortion animation (`dKyw_get_wind_vec()`,
  `d_kankyo.cpp`) nothing to reveal — sampling any distorted UV of a
  uniform color returns that same color, so it looked like a dead flat
  square with no waves at all.
- **Transparency investigation**: lowered the placeholder's alpha
  (255 → 130) to test whether the material's blend reads texture alpha.
  **Zero visible effect** — confirmed the shared capture texture's format
  genuinely supports alpha (`GX_TF_RGBA8`, checked directly in
  `mDoGph_gInf_c`'s init code, so it's not a format limitation), meaning
  this material's translucency (real on flatscreen) comes from something
  other than straightforward texture alpha that hasn't been identified —
  possibly the same class of "needs `patch()`/`diff()` to reach the GPU"
  issue as Round 4-7's TevColor/blend experiments in `d_kankyo.cpp`, or a
  genuinely different mechanism not yet investigated. **Unresolved.** Also
  likely explains the "goes solid blue near/underwater, can't see
  anything" report — same fixed-opacity surface, just filling more of the
  view when the VR camera gets close to or through the water plane (which
  happens more in VR than flatscreen, since head movement isn't clamped
  like a flatscreen camera's position).
- **Gradient instead of solid color (no visible difference)**: per-vertex
  2-color diagonal gradient (`GX_SRC_VTX`/`GX_CC_RASC`) instead of one flat
  KONST color, theorizing the UV distortion would reveal movement in the
  gradient. **No visible difference reported** — a smooth gradient varies
  too gradually across space for the water's actual (small) per-frame UV
  shift to move anything a viewer would notice.
- **Alternating stripes instead of a gradient**: 8 thin alternating-color
  vertical stripes instead of one smooth gradient, theorizing high-frequency
  detail would make the same small UV shift visibly move a stripe boundary.
  Result: one large washed-out pale band, not visible individual stripes —
  diagnosed as a NEW bug: the capture was being routed through
  `retry_captue_frame()` with a fake tiny (16×16) `view_port_class`, and
  that function computes its destination copy size as `width >> 1` of
  WHATEVER width/height it's given (correct for its normal
  608×448→304×224 use, but with a 16×16 fake source this told the copy
  system the destination was only 8×8 — not the real 304×224 texture), so
  the striped quad likely only ever filled a small corner of the real
  destination, leaving the rest at stale/default content.
- **Focused fix attempt (per explicit user agreement to try once more,
  then stop regardless) — did NOT resolve it**: bypassed
  `retry_captue_frame()` entirely for this capture; call
  `GXSetTexCopySrc`/`GXSetTexCopyDst`/`GXCopyTex` directly with the real
  destination texture's own dimensions
  (`mDoGph_gInf_c::getFrameBufferTimg()->width`/`height`) instead of a
  derived-from-fake-source size. User-reported result: **"same size"** —
  no visible change. This means the destination-size mismatch, while a
  real and now-fixed bug, was NOT the (or not the only) cause of the
  washed-out appearance. The actual remaining cause of "stripes don't show
  up as distinct stripes" is still unidentified.

**Current code state (all still in `m_Do_graphic.cpp`, functional, not
reverted)**: `captureGradientCornerReflection()` draws 8 alternating-color
stripes directly into the current eye pass's corner, then captures them
with the corrected full-size destination, replacing the real
`retry_captue_frame()` call in VR (which is now guarded to flatscreen-only
again). Water is stably colored (no crash, no head-motion flashing) but:
opaque (no transparency), and the stripe pattern does not visibly resolve
into stripes on the actual water surface for reasons not yet found.

**Options for a future session** (roughly in order of how promising they
seem, not yet attempted):
- Directly inspect (e.g. via RenderDoc, which is now a proven-useful tool
  for this project — see the Build Workflow section's notes on it) what
  the ACTUAL captured 304×224 texture looks like right after this capture
  runs, and separately what water's material actually samples from it at
  draw time. This would show directly whether the stripes really are
  present in the captured texture (ruling the capture side in/out) or
  whether the problem is entirely on water's sampling/UV side.
- Investigate the transparency mechanism properly: since it's confirmed
  NOT simple texture alpha, find where this material's actual blend
  factors/alpha source are configured (likely needs the same "find the
  legitimate per-frame `patch()`/`diff()` timing" investigation flagged as
  unresolved after Round 7's crash in the section below) rather than
  continuing to guess via texture content.
- **Second-camera idea (discussed 2026-07-29, not yet attempted — user's
  planned next-session direction)**: render an auxiliary,
  camera-**position**-anchored (but not head-**orientation**-anchored)
  view specifically for this capture, decoupling it from the VR headset's
  actual rapid/free head rotation — closer to how the original flatscreen
  camera behaves, which is what this whole screen-capture-as-reflection
  technique was originally designed around. Feasibility assessment:
  - **Performance is very likely NOT the limiting factor** if scoped down:
    low resolution keeps fragment/pixel cost trivial, and skipping most
    dynamic content (no shadows, no particles, no other water — obviously
    avoid recursively reflecting water) keeps CPU-side traversal and
    vertex cost low too. Reflections being lower-fidelity than the main
    view is normal in real games; this is not an unusual ask.
  - **The real risk is re-triggering this exact session's nested-
    offscreen-pass crash** (see "Solid-color-in-a-new-offscreen-pass
    (CRASHED...)" above). `mDoGph_Painter()`'s normal full scene draw
    invokes several systems that each do their OWN internal
    `GXCreateFrameBuffer`/`GXCopyTex` tricks (shadows, DOF blur, bloom,
    some particle effects) — and `begin_offscreen()`/`end_offscreen()`'s
    suspend/resume mechanism (`extern/aurora/lib/gfx/common.cpp`) only
    tracks ONE level of nesting (a single slot, not a stack), not
    arbitrary depth. A naive "just call the normal scene-draw function
    again, pointed at a new camera and a new small offscreen target" would
    very likely nest a THIRD level (VR eye pass → this new offscreen pass
    → whichever of those systems opens ITS OWN nested pass) and crash the
    same way. Mitigation: don't call the general "draw everything" path at
    all — call a narrow, deliberately-picked subset of draw calls instead
    (basically just the opaque terrain/BG list, e.g. whatever
    `dComIfGd_drawOpaList`-family function draws plain background
    geometry), skipping shadows/particles/bloom/DOF/other water entirely,
    both for the nesting risk and because reflections don't need that
    level of detail anyway.
  - **Worth checking early**: does `camera_p->view.viewMtx`/`projMtx` still
    hold a sensible flatscreen-style camera transform BEFORE VR's
    `beginEye()` overwrites it for each eye (`vr_stereo_render.hpp`)? If the
    game's underlying camera/follow logic still updates normally under the
    hood even while VR overrides the actual render matrices, that existing
    transform could be reused directly for this second render instead of
    computing a new camera-positioning scheme from scratch — a meaningful
    simplification if true, not yet confirmed either way.
- Accept the placeholder as sufficient for now (it's stable and doesn't
  crash) and deprioritize further reflection-quality work in favor of other
  VR issues (e.g. shadows, section 1).

**Original symptom description (superseded, kept for history)**:

**Round 1 fix attempt (tried, tested, NOT sufficient — but plausibly still
correct/needed)**: several water/reflection materials build their
environment-map reflection matrix via
`C_MTXLightPerspective(fovy, aspect, ...)` using `dComIfGd_getView()->fovy`/
`->aspect` directly — the same stale-for-VR fields the culling fix above
deliberately avoided touching. Added:
- `dusk::vr::getEyeSymmetricFov(float*, float*)` (`vr_main.hpp`/`.cpp`,
  backed by `vr_render::getEyeSymmetricFov()` in `vr_stereo_render.hpp`,
  which reuses the same symmetric-frustum-containing-the-real-asymmetric-FOV
  math already computed for the clipper fix).
- `dComIfGd_getReflectionFovAspect(f32*, f32*)` (`include/d/d_com_inf_game.h`,
  near `dComIfGd_getView()`) — returns `view->fovy/aspect` normally, or the
  VR-correct symmetric equivalent when `isRenderingToHeadset()`. Guarded
  `#if defined(TARGET_PC) && defined(DUSK_BUILDING_GAME)` (mods build
  `d_com_inf_game.h` too, without VR headers — don't remove that guard or
  the mod DLLs fail to compile).
- Applied at every confirmed water/reflection call site that read
  `dComIfGd_getView()->fovy`/`aspect` directly:
  `d_a_obj_groundwater.cpp` (`daGrdWater_c::Draw()`, the general lake actor),
  `d_a_obj_lv3Water.cpp`, `d_a_obj_lv3Water2.cpp`, `d_a_obj_lv3WaterB.cpp`
  (Lakebed-Temple-family water), `d_a_obj_rstair.cpp` (`mWaterModels`), and
  `d_kankyo.cpp`'s general BG water case (material names `MA10`/`MA02`,
  confirmed via the neighboring `mWaterSurfaceShineRate` reference).
  **Deliberately did not touch** `d_a_obj_tp.cpp` (uses the same
  `C_MTXLightPerspective` pattern but isn't clearly water-related — not
  reported broken, left alone) or `d_kankyo_rain.cpp` (same pattern via a
  `window_cam` pointer, likely the same underlying view but rain wasn't
  reported broken — left alone).
- **Result: rebuilt, tested in headset — water was still completely black.**
  So the fovy/aspect staleness theory, even if real, is not the (whole)
  cause. Do not re-attempt this exact fix; the code above is still in place
  (harmless/plausibly-still-correct) but something else is the actual cause.

**Round 2 (in progress — diagnostic logging added, awaiting test data)**:
Added `OutputDebugStringA` logging, gated to fire once per flatscreen/VR
state, at:
- `d_a_obj_groundwater.cpp`'s `daGrdWater_c::Draw()`: entry point (confirms
  the actor draws at all in VR), and after the lighting/tev setup — logs
  `tevStr.TevColor/AmbCol/TevKColor/mLightInf` (rules in/out a
  lighting-produces-black-color explanation distinct from the reflection
  matrix) — and after the reflection matrix computation, logs the actual
  `waterFovy`/`waterAspect` used and the resulting effect matrix contents.
  Log prefix: `[dusk::grdwater]`.
- `d_kankyo.cpp`'s general BG water case (`MA10`/`MA02`): logs material name,
  fovy, aspect once. Log prefix: `[dusk::kankyowater]`.
- **This has NOT yet been tested** — the immediate next step for whoever
  picks this up: launch in the headset, look at water, and read back
  whichever of `[dusk::grdwater]` / `[dusk::kankyowater]` lines appear (or
  note if NEITHER appears, which would mean the water the user is looking at
  uses some other rendering path entirely that hasn't been located yet —
  in which case, go looking for other `C_MTXLightPerspective` /
  `dComIfGd_getView()->fovy` call sites, or reconsider the mechanism from
  scratch: e.g. whether water's actual environment-map *texture* — as
  opposed to the coordinate-generation matrix — depends on something else
  VR never populates).
- Build succeeded with this logging in place; not yet tested in headset.

**Round 2 result (tested 2026-07-29)**: only `[dusk::kankyowater] VR=1
mat=MA02 fovy=110.00 aspect=0.964` fired — `[dusk::grdwater]` never appeared.
So the specific water body the user is looking at goes through `d_kankyo.cpp`'s
general BG-water path (`dKy_bg_MAxx_proc`, material `MA02`), not the
`daGrdWater_c` lake actor. fovy/aspect are sane (matches the Round 1 fix
working as intended) — confirms Round 1 is fully ruled out for this water,
not just "plausibly insufficient."

**Round 3 (bisect, tested 2026-07-29)**: temporarily skipped the *entire*
reflection-matrix branch in VR (treated `getTexMtx(0)` as NULL) in
`dKy_bg_MAxx_proc`. Water looked identical — still solid black. Caveat noted
at the time: this test is ambiguous on its own, since if this branch had
*never* run in VR this session, the material's effect matrix could
coincidentally still sample black either way.

**Rounds 4-6 (forced-color / forced-blend tests, tested 2026-07-29 — turned
out to be INVALID, see Round 7 correction below)**: forced this material's
`TevColor(0-3)`/`TevKColor(0-3)` registers to magenta (round 4), then also
logged+forced its blend mode from the original `GX_BM_BLEND` (src=`SRCALPHA`,
dst=`INVSRCALPHA` — completely ordinary alpha blending) to `GX_BM_NONE`
(round 5), all via direct `J3DMaterial`/`J3DBlend` setter calls right after
`dComIfGd_setListInvisisble()`. Water looked completely unchanged in VR
both times. Round 6 re-ran the same override **unconditionally, including
on flatscreen** as a control — and flatscreen water ALSO showed zero visible
change despite normally rendering correctly. **That control result
invalidates rounds 4 and 5's conclusions** — the overrides were never
reaching the real draw call at all (on either platform), so "no visible
effect" was never evidence about VR specifically, or about color/blend not
mattering. Do not cite rounds 4/5 as ruling anything out.

**Round 7 (root cause of rounds 4-6's non-effect, tested 2026-07-29 —
CRASHED, reverted, do not repeat without more care)**: `J3DMaterial::calc()`
(`J3DMaterial.cpp:267`, invoked via `simpleCalcMaterial` for the tex-mtx
work later in this same branch) only recomputes `mTexGenBlock` — it never
touches `mTevBlock`/`mColorBlock`/`mPEBlock`. Pushing those to the actual GX
command stream requires `J3DMaterial::patch()` (`J3DMaterial.cpp:240`,
calling `mTevBlock->patch()`/`mColorBlock->patch()`/`mTexGenBlock->patch()`
inside a `j3dSys.getMatPacket()` `beginPatch()`/`endPatch()` bracket) — which
rounds 4-6 never called, explaining the null effect on both platforms.
Tried calling `mat_p->patch()` directly after the overrides to fix this —
**this crashed immediately** with `[FATAL | aurora::gx::fifo]
command_processor: unknown opcode 0x7E`, a corrupted GX FIFO stream. Reverted
right away (game exited on the crash, no exe lock to worry about). Conclusion:
`patch()` (and presumably `diff()`) needs some packet-recording context that
isn't active during `dKy_bg_MAxx_proc` (this runs in the environment/kankyo
update pass, not during the model's actual draw-time material entry) —
calling it from here is unsafe until that context requirement is understood.
**Net result: we still do not have a working, safe way to force-apply
TevColor/blend changes to this material from this code path** — rounds 4-6's
"color/blend aren't the cause" conclusions are neither confirmed nor denied,
they're just uninformative. The reflection-matrix work from Round 1 remains
legitimately validated (it goes through `calc()`, which does work), but
nothing about color/blend/texture content has actually been tested yet.
- All diagnostic code from rounds 2/4/5/6 is still in `d_kankyo.cpp`
  (`dKy_bg_MAxx_proc`, the `MA10`/`MA02` branch) and safe (only the crashing
  `patch()` call was reverted). Only fires/logs once per VR/flat state via
  static bools; the magenta/blend overrides currently apply unconditionally
  (round 6's control-test change, not yet reverted back to VR-only gating).

**Drawn-list tracing (2026-07-29)**: `dComIfGd_setListInvisisble()` (called
unconditionally, VR or not, right before the `MA02`/`MA10` branch) routes
this material into the engine's "Invisible" list category — a legacy name;
functionally this is one of the two draw-list buckets
(`dComIfGd_drawOpaListInvisible`/`drawXluListInvisible`, in
`d_com_inf_game.cpp`) actually holding water among other things. Traced all
3 call sites of those draws in `mDoGph_Painter()` (`m_Do_graphic.cpp`,
around lines 2548-2554, 2642-2648, 2748-2758) — **none of them are
VR-guarded**; they're gated only by `g_env_light.is_blure` (0 vs 1, an
either/or pair covering both cases) and a `#if DEBUG` darkworld branch. So
geometry submission for this list is not skipped by any obvious guard in
VR — though this hasn't been confirmed by a direct "did GXCallDisplayList
actually execute" counter yet.
- Dead end found along the way: `dComIfGd_drawOpaListInvisible`/
  `drawXluListInvisible` are gated by
  `dusk::getSettings().game.disableWaterRefraction` — a manually-named
  ImGui debug checkbox ("Disable Water Refraction",
  `src/dusk/imgui/ImGuiMenuTools.cpp`), defaults `false`, has nothing to do
  with VR (not referenced anywhere under `src/dusk/vr/`). Since flatscreen
  water works fine with the same setting, this isn't the mechanism — just a
  suggestively-named coincidence. Don't chase this further unless the
  setting is confirmed toggled on somehow.
- Also checked all `Claude handoffs/VR_MOD_HANDOFF_*.md` files (3,4,5,7,8,9,10
  exist; `_11` is referenced in several code comments — e.g.
  `vr_stereo_render.hpp`, `vr_main.cpp` — but that `.md` was never actually
  written/saved). None of them mention water at all; they're all dated
  2026-07-22 through 2026-07-24, predating the water investigation
  entirely, and cover earlier stereo-rendering plumbing (submit/sync,
  `resolve_pass_checked`, foreign-pass substitution) that's now stable per
  the "Overall VR status" section above. Not useful for this bug beyond
  context already summarized in this file.

**Eye-buffer BMP dump (built + tested 2026-07-29 — confirmed, load-bearing
finding)**: built new texture-dump tooling reusing the VR mod's existing CPU
round-trip eye-readback path (`src/dusk/vr/vr_xr_submit.hpp`'s
`readbackEyeCopy()`, originally built for XR swapchain submission — see
`VR_MOD_HANDOFF_10`/`_11` comments there). Added `dumpEyeBufferToBmp()` (same
file, right before the `Session` class) — writes the already-mapped
`const uint8_t* mapped` CPU buffer straight to a 32bpp top-down BMP, handling
both `RGBA8Unorm*`/`BGRA8Unorm*` swapchain formats (throws/logs-and-skips on
anything else rather than guessing channel order). Hooked into
`readbackEyeCopy()` right after the `MapAsync` success check, gated to
re-dump every 90 frames per eye (overwriting `C:\Users\joeyw\dusklight\
vr_debug_eye0.bmp` / `vr_debug_eye1.bmp`) rather than a one-shot dump at VR
startup, so the file on disk always reflects a recent frame regardless of
when the user actually looks at water.
- **Result**: the dumped buffer shows a **distinct black silhouette exactly
  matching a lake/water-plane shape** (clean jagged shoreline edge,
  correctly positioned/occluding in the scene) sitting among otherwise
  correctly-rendered terrain — i.e. this is the game's own rendered output,
  not a compositor/XR-submission artifact. **This conclusively rules out any
  theory involving corruption after the game's render** (XR submission,
  swapchain format mismatch, compositor color-space issues, etc.) — the
  game itself really does render this material as solid black. It also
  confirms the geometry IS being drawn (distinct silhouette, correctly
  depth-sorted against the terrain) — not culled or skipped, contradicting
  the "geometry never submitted" theory from the drawn-list tracing below.
- BMPs can be converted for viewing with e.g. PowerShell's
  `[System.Drawing.Image]::FromFile(...).Save(..., Png)` (Read tool can't
  open raw `.bmp` directly).
- This tooling is generically reusable for future VR visual-symptom
  debugging (whatever's rendered to either eye, once per ~90 frames) — not
  water-specific. Leave in place; harmless (a bit of extra CPU-side work
  writing files every 90 frames), matches the "diagnostic scaffolding stays
  until the bug's fixed" workflow rule.

**Ideas not yet tried (SUPERSEDED — kept for history only)**: everything
below was written while still hunting for the cause and turned out to be
barking up the wrong tree entirely — the real cause was that `dKy_bg_
MAxx_proc`'s texture *is* `retry_captue_frame()`'s shared screen-capture
target, just not written via any call visible from inside that function
itself (the capture happens earlier in the frame, in `m_Do_graphic.cpp`).
See the ROOT-CAUSED writeup at the top of this section instead.
- ~~find a SAFE way to force-test this material's actual TEV/blend/texture
  content~~ — turned out to be irrelevant; the fix required zero changes to
  `dKy_bg_MAxx_proc` or any `J3DMaterial`/TEV/blend state at all.
- ~~dump the buffer with vs. without the Round 1 reflection-matrix fix~~ —
  moot; Round 1 was legitimate but the texture it was projecting was simply
  never being written to.
- ~~confirm whether the reflection texture is a static baked asset~~ — it
  is NOT; it's the shared 304×224 screen-capture texture, confirmed via
  RenderDoc.
- A GPU debugger capture (RenderDoc) turned out to be exactly the right
  call — this is genuinely how the actual root cause got found, once the
  build-and-guess `OutputDebugStringA` loop hit its limits. If a future
  investigation on this project stalls the same way, reach for RenderDoc
  sooner rather than later (see the RenderDoc setup notes elsewhere in
  this file, if kept, or re-derive: launch the game via RenderDoc's
  "Launch Application" — NOT its own hotkey capture, which only sees the
  desktop window's mostly-empty Present() calls while VR is active — and
  trigger a capture from in-game code instead, bracketing the actual
  `aurora_begin_frame()`/`aurora_end_frame()` pair in `m_Do_main.cpp`).

### 4. Underwater bloom — investigated, NOT the water-black bug, still disabled
- `m_Do_graphic.cpp`: `mDoGph_gInf_c::getBloom()->draw()` (triggered near/in
  water via `camera_water_in_status`) is guarded off entirely for VR, same
  for the `retry_captue_frame()` call that feeds it. Comment at the guard
  explicitly says "real fix is giving offscreen passes protected identity in
  common.cpp (option (b), not done here)" — which is what the `extern/aurora`
  nesting fix (#1 above) implements. **However**: `bloom_c::draw()` samples
  from `getFrameBufferTexObj()`, which is only populated by
  `retry_captue_frame()` — a plain `GXCopyTex`/`resolve_pass_into()`
  substitution, NOT a `GXCreateFrameBuffer`, so it is NOT covered by the
  aurora nesting fix at all. `resolve_pass_into()` still unconditionally
  drops the copy when the current pass is protected (VR eye) — see its
  comment in `extern/aurora/lib/gfx/common.cpp`. So even removing both
  guards would very likely still show stale/no bloom, since the capture
  feeding it can never succeed during VR as-is.
- This was a *dead end for the water-black bug specifically* — bloom is an
  additive glow overlay; if it failed to render you'd expect no glow, not a
  fully opaque black base surface. Left disabled; not touched further.
- **UPDATE 2026-07-29 — the underlying `resolve_pass_into()` limitation
  described above is now FIXED** (see section 3's writeup): it no longer
  unconditionally drops the copy when the pass is protected, it lets the
  substitution through safely instead. This was fixed for water, but the
  fix is generic (in `resolve_pass_into()` itself, not water-specific) — so
  bloom's OWN `retry_captue_frame()`/`getBloom()->draw()` VR guards
  (still in place, not touched this session) could very plausibly now be
  safely re-enabled too, the same way water's was. **Not yet attempted or
  tested** — bloom's guards are separate call sites from the one re-enabled
  for water; re-enabling them is a candidate follow-up, not yet done.

## Key lesson learned this session

Don't infer that an uncommitted fix supersedes a nearby disable guard just
because they're both present in the diff — ask, or look for explicit
"confirmed/tested" language, before re-enabling. A conversation that resumes
mid-investigation (e.g. after a closed/reopened prompt) cannot tell "fix
landed, disable is stale" apart from "fix was tried and rejected, decision
already made" from the code alone — both look identical in a diff. This bit
us once already on the shadow-stretching guard (see #1).
